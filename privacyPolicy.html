  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>We respect your privacy here at ayofitness. This privacy statement outlines how ayofitness may gather, use, and share information about you via its website or app. We recommend that you review this policy periodically to understand how we handle your personal information because it may change as we update or develop our services. You consent to ayofitness using information about you in line with this privacy statement if you use this website and its services.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What information do we collect?</li>
  <p>Currently, when users choose to fill out an e-mail submission form to ask questions about our business and about membership, Ayofitness collects information from them solely for contact purposes (such as name, e-mail address, business and/or home address, age, zip code, and travel preferences). Other optional information, such as extra contact information and specific demographic data (such as a phone number and gender), is occasionally requested.</p>
  <li>How do we use your information?</li>
  <p>Your information may be used by us for a variety of things, such as providing and maintaining your Ayofitness membership, offering member support, maintaining the website and mobile application, informing you of special deals, promotions, and company news via email and/or text message, and compiling usage statistics and other information about how you use the website's services.</p>
  <li>How do we use your email information?</li>
  <p>We at Ayofitness appreciate your privacy concerns. To deliver a more individualized and pertinent experience, we gather email information. When you sign up, inquire about membership, or ask for a free trial guest pass, we will ask for your email address so that we can send you emails about special deals, Ayofitness news, and future club openings. Providing updated information will serve as a "opt back-in" if you previously chose not to receive communications from us. Simply click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails to choose not to receive promotional emails from us. Although we make an effort to refresh our email list periodically, you might hear from someone else before we are able to unsubscribe you.Please be aware that you will still get communications from Member Services about your member account. Any of your available contact methods (including email, mailing, phone, and fax) may be used by Ayofitness to get in touch with you for routine administration tasks including freeze requests, online purchases, and significant service notifications.
  </p>

  <li>How do we use your phone number?</li>
  <p>Your consent to receive SMS text alerts from Ayofitness is obtained when you offer your mobile phone number, and you also attest that you are the regular user of the provided phone number. You can use an automatic calling system to send text notifications. The purchase of any products or services does not require your approval, which you can withdraw at any time by sending the message STOP in response to any SMS text message you receive. Data and message rates can be charged.
